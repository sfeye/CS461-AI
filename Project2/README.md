### Running the application - git checkout master

* Open the project in IntelliJ and import all dependencies using maven install
* Configure your SDK appropriately, I use 11.0.3 and a language level of 8+
* Run the driver class `Project2Application`

### Using the application

* After compilation a terminal window will pop up allowing for textual input
* Input an integer between 0 & 6 to place your piece
* The program will run until a player manages to get 4 in a row or there is a draw
