# Project 1 : Guided Search

### Running the application

* Open the project in IntelliJ and import all dependencies using maven install
* Configure your SDK appropriately, I use 11.0.3 and a language level of 8+
* Run the driver class `Project1Application`

### Using the application

* After compilation a terminal window will pop up allowing for textual input
* Input your start and end locations (a list of these can be found in the cities text file [here](https://github.com/sfeye/CS461-AI/blob/master/Project1/src/main/resources/cities.txt))
* The program will return the path that you should take based on a best-fit algorithm
